        <h3> Genetics Targeting C/EBP Beta for Enhanced SMN2 Expression in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Mouse Models</h3>
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Yale University</p>
        <p><strong> class:</strong> BIOL 103: Genetics </p>
        <p><strong>Dates:</strong> Spring 2023</p>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This project focuses on the therapeutic potential of overexpressing the transcription factor C/EBP Beta to enhance SMN2 expression in SMA mouse models. The project aims to investigate whether overexpression of C/EBP Beta can mitigate the severity of SMA by improving motor neuron survival and function.</p>

        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>The primary goal of this research is to determine the extent to which C/EBP Beta can upregulate SMN2 expression, leading to potential therapeutic approaches for Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The study seeks to enhance the production of full-length SMN proteins in motor neurons, which are critical in reducing SMA phenotypes.</p>

        <h4>Methodology</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cell Culture:</strong> Utilize iPSCs derived from SMA mouse models and healthy controls, differentiating them into motor neuron progenitor cells to study SMN2 expression.</li>
            <li><strong>C/EBP Beta Overexpression:</strong> Generate stable cell lines overexpressing C/EBP Beta using viral vectors, with GFP reporters for identification.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantitative Analysis:</strong> Measure SMN2 mRNA levels using qRT-PCR, followed by Western blotting to assess full-length SMN2 protein production.</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental Controls:</strong> Implement negative controls with empty vectors and positive controls with known SMN2 enhancers for comparison.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Use appropriate statistical tests to evaluate the significance of changes in SMN2 expression across different experimental conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Transgenic Mice Generation:</strong> Inject C/EBP Beta overexpression vectors into fertilized mouse oocytes and breed SMA-affected mice with transgenic offspring to assess improvements in motor function.</li>
            <li><strong>Phenotypic Analysis:</strong> Perform motor function tests such as grip strength and histological analysis of spinal cord sections to evaluate motor neuron survival in transgenic and control mice.</li>
        </ul>
